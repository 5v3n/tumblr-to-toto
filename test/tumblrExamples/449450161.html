&lt;blockquote&gt;“When you turn guesses into plans, you enter a danger zone. Plans let the past drive the future. They put blinders on you. “This is where we’re going because, well, that’s where we said we were going.” And that’s the problem: Plans are inconsistent with improvisation.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve read the excerpts and am familiar enough with the 37signals blog that I know I will enjoy this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s something that those of us who work in traditional 9-5 environments especially need to read, as we have the most to overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;



&lt;p&gt;Totally agree - plus I&amp;#8217;m happy about the fact that my boss ordered the book for our office bib ;-).&lt;/p&gt;</regular-body><tag>rework</tag><tag>9to5</tag><tag>workplace cuture</tag></post>
